ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin. I'm a Software Engineer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Currently I'm working as a Full Stack JS/TS Developer for Waterplan. My experience is mostly in front-end web apps with React but I really love VueJS too. I created the React Chat Widget component library and hope to keep contributing to Open Source in the future.

ðŸ¤“ I'm currently learning game development in Unreal Engine. Though I love web development, I really want to try something new and game development is something I want to start on doing in the future, who knows?

ðŸ“« If you want to reach out to me, please email me at martin.callegari94@gmail.com
